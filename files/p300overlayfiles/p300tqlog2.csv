Predominantly located in nucleus during G(0) phase and in the cytoplasm during G1/S phase.","ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X (EC 3.6.4.13) (DEAD box protein 3, X-chromosomal) (DEAD box, X isoform) (Helicase-like protein 2) (HLP2)",GO:0003677; GO:0003723; GO:0003924; GO:0004003; GO:0004004; GO:0005524; GO:0005576; GO:0005634; GO:0005730; GO:0005737; GO:0005741; GO:0005829; GO:0006351; GO:0006413; GO:0007059; GO:0008134; GO:0008143; GO:0008190; GO:0008625; GO:0009615; GO:0010494; GO:0010501; GO:0010628; GO:0016032; GO:0016055; GO:0016607; GO:0016887; GO:0017111; GO:0017148; GO:0030307; GO:0030308; GO:0031333; GO:0031369; GO:0032728; GO:0033592; GO:0034063; GO:0034774; GO:0035556; GO:0035613; GO:0042256; GO:0043024; GO:0043065; GO:0043066; GO:0043154; GO:0043273; GO:0043280; GO:0043312; GO:0043539; GO:0045070; GO:0045087; GO:0045296; GO:0045727; GO:0045944; GO:0045948; GO:0048027; GO:0070062; GO:0071243; GO:0071470; GO:0071651; GO:0071902; GO:0090263; GO:0097193; GO:1900087; GO:1903608; GO:1904813; GO:2001243,1.00E-07,9.27E-05,1.00E-07,0.141546167,0.115322665,0.109064726,0.115322665,-3.116252013,0.121946887,0.061004409,12.73547113,0.000137463,0.006762548,-1.111969932,73243,2.169889659,6,2,0,1.00E-07,0.115322665,1153226.65,20.13724465,-2.820655416,-3.116252013,-3.196743514

Cytoplasmic when it is unstabilized (high level of phosphorylation) or bound to CDH1. Translocates to the nucleus when it is stabilized (low level of phosphorylation). Interaction with GLIS2 and MUC1 promotes nuclear translocation. Interaction with EMD inhibits nuclear localization. The majority of beta-catenin is localized to the cell membrane. In interphase, colocalizes with CROCC between CEP250 puncta at the proximal end of centrioles, and this localization is dependent on CROCC and CEP250. In mitosis, when NEK2 activity increases, it localizes to centrosomes at spindle poles independent of CROCC. Colocalizes with CDK5 in the cell-cell contacts and plasma membrane of undifferentiated and differentiated neuroblastoma cells. Interaction with FAM53B promotes translocation to the nucleus (PubMed:25183871). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B6V8E6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25183871}.",Catenin beta-1 (Beta-catenin),GO:0000122; GO:0000578; GO:0000904; GO:0000922; GO:0001085; GO:0001102; GO:0001105; GO:0001569; GO:0001658; GO:0001701; GO:0001702; GO:0001708; GO:0001711; GO:0001764; GO:0001837; GO:0001840; GO:0002052; GO:0002053; GO:0002089; GO:0003266; GO:0003338; GO:0003340; GO:0003682; GO:0003700; GO:0003713; GO:0005622; GO:0005634; GO:0005654; GO:0005667; GO:0005719; GO:0005737; GO:0005813; GO:0005829; GO:0005886; GO:0005911; GO:0005912; GO:0005913; GO:0005916; GO:0005923; GO:0005925; GO:0005938; GO:0007155; GO:0007160; GO:0007223; GO:0007268; GO:0007398; GO:0007403; GO:0008022; GO:0008134; GO:0008285; GO:0009948; GO:0009950; GO:0009954; GO:0010718; GO:0010909; GO:0016020; GO:0016055; GO:0016323; GO:0016328; GO:0016342; GO:0016525; GO:0016600; GO:0019827; GO:0019899; GO:0019900; GO:0019901; GO:0019903; GO:0021819; GO:0022009; GO:0030018; GO:0030027; GO:0030054; GO:0030316; GO:0030331; GO:0030521; GO:0030539; GO:0030877; GO:0030902; GO:0030997; GO:0031016; GO:0031069; GO:0031528; GO:0031641; GO:0032212; GO:0032331; GO:0032355; GO:0032481; GO:0032991; GO:0032993; GO:0033077; GO:0033234; GO:0034333; GO:0034394; GO:0034750; GO:0035050; GO:0035112; GO:0035115; GO:0035116; GO:0035257; GO:0035315; GO:0035635; GO:0036023; GO:0042129; GO:0042475; GO:0042493; GO:0042733; GO:0043065; GO:0043123; GO:0043410; GO:0043525; GO:0044325; GO:0044334; GO:0044336; GO:0045177; GO:0045202; GO:0045294; GO:0045296; GO:0045453; GO:0045603; GO:0045669; GO:0045671; GO:0045743; GO:0045765; GO:0045892; GO:0045893; GO:0045944; GO:0045976; GO:0046332; GO:0046982; GO:0048096; GO:0048145; GO:0048469; GO:0048471; GO:0048489; GO:0048538; GO:0048599; GO:0048617; GO:0048643; GO:0048660; GO:0048715; GO:0050681; GO:0050767; GO:0050808; GO:0051091; GO:0051145; GO:0051149; GO:0051571; GO:0051884; GO:0051973; GO:0060066; GO:0060070; GO:0060440; GO:0060441; GO:0060479; GO:0060484; GO:0060492; GO:0060548; GO:0060742; GO:0060769; GO:0060789; GO:0060916; GO:0061154; GO:0061198; GO:0061324; GO:0061549; GO:0061550; GO:0070062; GO:0070369; GO:0070411; GO:0070491; GO:0070602; GO:0071363; GO:0071681; GO:0071944; GO:0072033; GO:0072053; GO:0072054; GO:0072079; GO:0072182; GO:0090279; GO:0097718; GO:0098609; GO:1903204; GO:1904501; GO:1904793; GO:1904798; GO:1904837; GO:1904886; GO:1904888; GO:1904948; GO:1904954; GO:1990138; GO:1990403; GO:1990791; GO:1990907; GO:1990909; GO:2000008; GO:2000017; GO:2000144; GO:2001234,0.000137303,6.75E-06,9.15E-06,0.08662645,0.119659078,0.129557336,0.119659078,-3.062998238,0.111896554,0.055999344,8.958270813,0.000598971,0.014321776,-2.913515523,85497,1.844003115,17,0,0,9.15E-06,0.119659078,13083.61301,13.67547337,-3.529048588,-3.062998238,-2.948337383
